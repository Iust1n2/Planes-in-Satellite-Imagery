# Planes in Satellite Imagery Binary Classification

## Overview

Binary image classifier implemented using a Convolutional Neural Network in PyTorch. The classifier is designed to classify images into one of two classes: "plane" or "no-plane."

## Data

Data consists of satellite imagery of 4 airports (scenes), fragmented into 32000 images, from which 8000 are planes and 24000 are not planes.
